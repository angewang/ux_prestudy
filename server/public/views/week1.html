      <h2>Week 1: UX Fundamentals</h2>
      <!--<img style="float: right; padding-right: 20px" src="/images/ux-processModel-identify.png" />-->
      <p>This week, we will start to explore some of the common principles, tools, and methods that are essential for being an effective UXer. You will start creating UX artifacts through hand sketching. You will also gain experience with conducting directed storytelling, a key UX design research method, in order to help you identify the goals of your users. Most of this week’s content will keep us focused on the “Identify” portion of our design process. This stage helps us know what we’re designing and why, and is essential to working effectively in subsequent stages in the design process.
</p>
<p>
  Our goals for this week are for you to:
  <ul>
    <li>Understand the UX process model and the principles of user-centered design</li>
    <li>Know the importance of personas and their role in the UX design process</li>
    <li>Gain experience with converting ideas into hand drawn sketches</li>
    <!-- <li>Increase your familiarity with Adobe Illustrator</li> -->
    <li>Gain experience with conducting directed storytelling</li>
  </ul>
</p>

                Our goal as UXers is to learn as much as we can about the people who use our designs: what makes them happy, confused, satisfied, frustrated, etc. This week’s lesson will start to talk about our users and how they aren’t us—a key principle to abide by when you’re a UXer. There are some ways we can help to make our users real and different from us, including conducting research and crafting personas.

            The following methods introduced this week are common to use when doing discovery research at the start of a design project. You will be conducting directed storytelling, so be sure to read about that method especially carefully!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Contextual research</strong> is an ethnographic research method that puts you into your user’s context in order to better understand how they do their work and achieve their goals.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Directed storytelling</strong> is a way to elicit meaningful stories from participants about their previous experiences with products or services.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Personas</strong> are a fictional representation of your users, based on synthesized research findings. They are typically used to guide the design team’s decisions and keep everyone focused on user goals.

          <div data-toggle="collapse" class="collapsed" data-target="#w1-3"><span class="action-type">3. Read</span>about sketching and critique
          </div>
          <div id="w1-3" class="collapse sub-content">
            <p><strong>Sketching</strong> is an essential skill for a designer to have, which is why we’ll be working on it through the duration of the program. If you feel concerned about your sketching skills, don’t worry. Many people equate sketching with “being good at drawing” but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. As a designer, pen & paper are the cheapest and most accessible tools used to communicate ideas or translate words into visuals that can be understood by everyone. Sometimes, it’s all you need to get everyone on the same page and keep the team moving forward!
            </p>
            <p>One fun way to get more comfortable with sketches is to start taking <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/11/how-to-get-started-with-sketchnotes/
" target="_blank">“sketchnotes”</a> of the week’s lecture materials! You’ll be able to practice some of the principles we are learning about (e.g. hierarchy, chunking), as well as practice thinking on the fly while letting go of perfectionism! A double-win!
            </p>
            <p><strong>Critique</strong> is another activity that designers are used to, and might seem unusual or scary when you first start. But once you experience the power of an effective critique, you’ll might wonder how you could ever design without one! Critiquing is a professional forum used for giving and receiving feedback on how well your designs are achieving their goals. It is not a criticism of your personal abilities, but rather a professional discussion about your work. Critique is a great place to exercise and strengthen your design vocabulary while practicing your presentation and listening skills. </p>

          Although you were thinking about a particular audience when you made your TV remote sketches, you got away with making a lot of assumptions about what that group of people wants from that device. UXers are always working to confirm or deny assumptions by finding out what users really need. Throughout the program, we’ll work through a number of methods that UXers employ to get this information.
        </p>
        <p>
          One method is to conduct directed storytelling with your users, in order to listen to and uncover insights from their firsthand experiences. Now is a great time to practice this research method, as you’ll be required to do more of it once you get into the classroom. If you need to refresh your understanding of the method you can refer back to the reading assigned earlier this week. The main objective is to learn about a memorable experience your users had in order to use those insights to help you design a more meaningful experience in the future.

			  <p>Now is a great time to start learning how to move from sketches to a digital medium. (It’s usually easier for beginners and experts alike to start with a sketch plan before working with a digital tool). If you’re totally new to Adobe Illustrator, don’t worry—we’ll walk you through the basics and continue to learn more about this tool throughout the program. We don't expect you to become an expert. We just want to equip you with skills in a tool used for digital content creation. Once you become familiar with Illustrator, many of the others become easier to learn!
        </p>
			  <p>We’ll continue next week with additional demos before embarking on your first Illustrator-based assignment.
