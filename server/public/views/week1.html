      <h2>Week 1: UX Fundamentals</h2>
      <!--<img style="float: right; padding-right: 20px" src="/images/ux-processModel-identify.png" />-->
      <p>This week, we will start to explore some of the common principles, tools, and methods that are essential to designing effectively. You will start creating design artifacts through hand sketching. You will also gain experience with conducting contextual inquiry, a key UX design research method, in order to help you identify the goals of your users. Most of this week’s content will keep us focused on the “Identify” portion of our design process. This stage helps us know what we’re designing and why, and is essential to working effectively in subsequent stages.
</p>
<p>
  Our goals for this week are for you to:
  <ul>
    <li>Understand the UX process model and the principles of user-centered design</li>
    <li>Know the importance of personas and their role in the UX design process</li>
    <li>Gain experience with converting ideas into hand drawn sketches</li>
    <li>Increase your familiarity with Adobe Illustrator</li>
    <li>Gain experience with conducting contextual inquiry</li>
  </ul>

              <p>
                Our goal as UXers is to learn as much as we can about the people who use our designs: what makes them happy, confused, satisfied, frustrated, etc. This week’s lesson will start to talk about our users and how they aren’t us—a key principle to abide by when you’re a UXer. There are some ways we can help to make our users real and different from us, including conducting research and crafting personas.

            Two key concepts introduced this week are personas and contextual inquiry.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Contextual research</strong> is an ethnographic research method that puts you into your user’s context in order to better understand how they do their work and achieve their goals.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Personas</strong> are a fictional representation of your users, based on synthesized research findings. They are typically used to guide the design team’s decisions and keep everyone focused on user goals.

          <div data-toggle="collapse" class="collapsed" data-target="#w1-3"><span class="action-type">Read</span>about sketching and critique
          </div>
          <div id="w1-3" class="collapse sub-content">
            <p><strong>Sketching</strong> is an essential skill for a designer to have, which is why we’ll be working on it through the duration of the program. If you feel concerned about your sketching skills, don’t worry. Many people equate sketching with “being good at drawing” but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. As a designer, pen & paper are the cheapest and most accessible tools used to communicate ideas or translate words into visuals that can be understood by everyone. Sometimes, it’s all you need to get everyone on the same page and keep the team moving forward!
            </p>
            <p>One fun way to get more comfortable with sketches is to start taking <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/11/how-to-get-started-with-sketchnotes/
" target="_blank">“sketchnotes”</a> of the week’s lecture materials! You’ll be able to practice some of the principles we are learning about (e.g. hierarchy, chunking), as well as practice thinking on the fly while letting go of perfectionism! A double-win!
            </p>
            <p><strong>Critique</strong> is another activity that designers are used to, and might seem unusual or scary when you first start. But once you experience the power of an effective critique, you’ll might wonder how you could ever design without one! Critiquing is a professional forum used for giving and receiving feedback on how well your designs are achieving their goals. It is not a criticism of your personal abilities, but rather a professional discussion about your work. Critique is a great place to exercise and strengthen your design vocabulary while practicing your presentation and listening skills. </p>

			  <p>Now is a great time to start learning how to move from sketches to a digital medium. (It’s usually easier for beginners and experts alike to start with a sketch plan before working with a digital tool). If you’re totally new to Adobe Illustrator, don’t worry—we’ll walk you through the basics and continue to learn more about this tool throughout the program. We don't expect you to become an expert. We just want to equip you with skills in a tool used for digital content creation. Once you become familiar with Illustrator, many of the others become easier to learn!
        </p>
			  <p>We’ll continue next week with additional demos before embarking on your first Illustrator-based assignment.

			  <p>
          Although you were thinking about a particular audience when you made your TV remote sketches, you got away with making a lot of assumptions about what that group of people wants from that device. UXers are always working to confirm or deny assumptions by finding out what users really need. Throughout the program, we’ll work through a number of methods that UXers employ to get this information.
        </p>
        <p>
          One method is to go “in-situ” or into the context of your users in order to find out how they work and play, what makes them frustrated or delighted, and where the opportunities are for your design to improve their lives. This is called contextual inquiry, as you know from your earlier reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now is a great time to lightly practice this research method, as you’ll be required to do more of it once you get into the classroom. If you need to refresh your understanding of the method you can refer back to the reading assigned earlier this week.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>NOTE:</strong> This assignment will continue for the rest of Prework, so choose wisely!

          <strong>Directions:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol class="list">
          <li>
            Choose one of the following tasks: (1) finding and booking a commercial airline flight or (2) finding a restaurant and booking a meal reservation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Decide whether you want to design a website or smartphone app for the chosen task.
          </li>
          <li>
            Define an audience by completing the statement: “My user is a _____, who wants to [find and book a flight OR find a restaurant and book a meal reservation].” <em>(e.g. "My user is a recent retiree who wants to find a restaurant and book a meal reservation.")</em> Make sure that you choose a group of people that you can easily meet with, as you’ll be required to do research with them twice throughout Prework.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pick three people within your audience and have them complete the task you’ve chosen (in step 1) using an existing tool of the same medium. <em>(For example: If you have chosen to do a flight booking website, you could watch them use Kayak.com. If you have chosen to design a restaurant reservation app, you could watch people use the OpenTable app.)</em>
          </li>
           <li>
            Document your research findings.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Identify commonalities and differences amongst your three research participants.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Revise your goals statement to further describe your user and their specific goals.<em>For example: My user is a working professional who wants to quickly find a trendy place for happy hour and date nights, or my user is a retiree who wants to find an economical and safe place to vacation with his spouse.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Include interesting quotes to support your findings.
                </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
