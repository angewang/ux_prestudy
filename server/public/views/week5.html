      <h2>Week 5: Evaluation</h2>
      <!--<img style="float: right; padding-right: 40px" src="/images/ux-processModel-evaluate.png" />-->
      <p>This week, we will introduce the most common ways that UX designers evaluate the effectiveness and usability of designs, including think-aloud usability tests.  We will explore how to conduct these evaluations, including preparation before, activities during, and what to do with the results. You will learn how to conduct a usability evaluation of a design and gain an understanding of what to do with the results in order to make recommendations and improvements.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be clear that this week we are spending time in the “evaluate” portion of the design process!
      </p>

     <p>
       By the end of this week, you will:
       <ul>
         <li>
           Gain experience executing a usability test on your prototype
         </li>
         <li>
           Gain familiarity with how to report findings in a test report
         </li>
         <li>
           Increase your understanding of how to make recommendations research findings
         </li>

            <p>
              The focus of this week’s content is to gain familiarity with the tools and methods used to understand what users are doing and why they are doing it. Many times, we will want to combine methods, such as Google Analytics and usability testing, in order to get a richer picture of what is going on when people interact with our designs. Usability testing is one of the simplest ways to get feedback on wireframes and prototypes and can be conducted within any budget while still yielding meaningful results.

              <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/people/jakob-nielsen/" target="_blank">Jakob Nielsen’s</a> research concludes that testing with zero users will provide zero results (obviously), but even testing with one user can be useful. However, as a general rule, he recommends testing with 3-5 users per design iteration, in order to get the maximum returns on your efforts.

                When conducting a usability test (or design evaluation of any kind, really), it is important to understand that while the research is not considered scientific, you do want your results to be as clean as possible. This means that you need to be aware of "priming" your users before and during an evaluation session and otherwise exposing them to stimuli that would affect their responses.

              You’re already a bit familiar with Steve Krug and his take on usability, based on the reading you did in Week 3. This week, as you prepare for conducting some usability tests of your own, it’s a great time to watch a sample think-aloud usability test conducted by Krug himself. The test runs about 24 minutes but really is worth watching to get a true sense of how these tests are facilitated and structured.

                  For many of you, this assignment may be the first usability test that you are conducting in a formal manner. If you’re uncomfortable or unsure of yourself, don’t worry—we will continue conducting tests of this nature a number of times throughout the program, and you’ll continually improve with practice. However, the best way to keep yourself as calm and prepared as possible is to prepare a test script. This is something even seasoned experts do, as shown in <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/DigitalGov/usability-testing-report-template" target="_blank">this presentation</a> and this <a href="http://www.sage-research.com/v4/sage_usability_study_report_example.pdf" target="_blank">formal report sample</a>.
