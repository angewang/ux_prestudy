              Welcome to Prime! We’re excited to welcome you to the inaugural UX cohort! During the next 18 weeks you will gain experience in the entire UX lifecycle, from research, through prototyping, design, evaluation, and development. You’ll spend time working through the design process of identifying goals, prototyping solutions, and evaluating how well those solutions meet the goals. We’re going to give you a taste of this complete process here in Prework, although in a more lightweight fashion, introducing some design principles, methods, and tools in the process.

              <p style="text-align: left">
                The goal of Prework is to ensure that everyone comes to the classroom speaking a common (in this case, design) language. This means that for some of you there may be content that is familiar or refresher content, for others, this may all be new to you. In any case, we expect you to fully engage with the content, with your peers, and with your instructors. This is a team based learning environment. We selected each of you because we feel you have something to bring to the group as a whole. We want you to engage with each other and with us.

              <p style="text-align: left">
                As a UX designer, you will be focused on crafting experiences that are both usable and meaningful for their intended users. You will also be responsible for understanding the business context that your design will operate within and the technical constraints and possibilities that will make it functional and reliable (which is the focus of the software developers). We will start to understand what this takes in these next six weeks, and will dig even deeper once you’re in the classroom!

              After graduating 16 cohorts, it’s great to look back at and remember the stories of those participants in our very first software development cohort. It makes us even more excited to welcome you to Prime as our first cohort for UX! We’re glad you are on this journey with us as we set out to change the face of UX education in the Twin Cities. We look forward to the stories you will share once you complete this 18 week journey and begin your new career as UX designers!

      <h2>Week 1: UX Fundamentals</h2>
      <p>This week, we will start to explore some of the common principles, tools, and methods that are essential to designing effectively. You will start your journey of creating design artifacts, through hand sketching. You will also gain experience with conducting contextual inquiry, a key UX design research method, in order to help you identify the goals of your users. Most of this week’s content will keep us focused on the “Identify” portion of our design process, although we will dip a bit into prototyping for early practice. This stage helps us know what we’re designing and why, and is essential to working effectively in subsequent stages!
</p>
<p>
  <img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" src="/images/ux-processModel-identify.png" />
</p>
<p>
  Our goals for this week are for you to:
  <ul>
    <li>Understand the UX process model and the principles of user-centered design</li>
    <li>Know the importance of personas and their role in the UX design process</li>
    <li>Gain experience with converting ideas into hand drawn sketches</li>
    <li>Gain familiarity with using digital tools (Adobe Illustrator)</li>
    <li>Gain experience with conducting contextual inquiry</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Mark your calendars!</strong> This week’s Live Chat options are: Wednesday, December 7, 6:30-7:30pm or Friday, December 9, 12:00-1:00pm
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Remember:</strong> We recommend that you take a look at the week in its entirety before getting started.

          <div id="w1-1" class="collapse sub-content">
              <p>
                Throughout this program, we’ll be learning a lot more about the people who use our designs: what makes them happy, confused, satisfied, frustrated. This week’s lesson will start to talk about our users and how they aren’t us—a key principle to abide by when you’re a UX designer. There are some ways we can help to make our users real and different from us, including conducting research and crafting personas. You’ll learn more about this during the lesson and the rest of the week’s materials.

            Two key concepts that are being introduced this week are that of personas and contextual inquiry. Contextual research is an ethnographic research method that puts you into your user’s context in order to better understand how they do their work and achieve their goals (as pertains to the design you’re working on). Personas are a fictional representation of your users, (ideally) based on the sy
            nthesis of the research you’ve done with users in your target segments. They are typically used to guide the design team’s decisions and keep everyone focused on user goals.

          </div>
          <div id="w1-3" class="collapse sub-content">
            <p><strong>Sketching</strong> is an essential skill for a designer to have, which is why we’ll be working on it through the duration of the program. (It’s also the main reason why you’re required to invest in some good pens and a sketchbook!) If you feel concerned about your sketching skills, don’t worry. Many people equate sketching with “being good at drawing” but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. As a designer, pen & paper is the cheapest and most accessible tool used to communicate ideas or translate words into visuals that can be understood by everyone. Sometimes, it’s all you need to get everyone on the same page and keep the team moving forward!
            </p>
            <p>One fun way to get more comfortable with sketches is to start taking <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/11/how-to-get-started-with-sketchnotes/
" target="_blank">“sketchnotes”</a> of the week’s lecture materials! You’ll be able to practice some of the principles we are learning about (e.g. hierarchy, chunking), as well as practice thinking on the fly while letting go of perfectionism! A double-win!
            </p>
            <p><strong>Critique</strong> is another activity that designers are used to, and might seem unusual or scary when you first start. But  once you experience the power of an effective critique, you’ll might wonder how you could ever design without them! Critiquing is a professional forum used for giving and receiving feedback on how well (or not) your designs are achieving their goals. It is not a discussion of your personal abilities, but rather a professional discussion about your work. Critique a great place to exercise and strengthen your design vocabulary while practicing your presentation and listening skills.

			  <p>Now is a great time to start learning how to move from sketches to a digital medium. (It’s usually easier for beginners and experts alike to start with a sketch plan before working with a digital tool). If you’re totally new to Adobe Illustrator, don’t worry—we’ll walk you through the basics and continue to learn more about this tool throughout the program. Of course, Illustrator just one of many tools used by designers to create digital content. But, once you become familiar with this tool, many of the others become easier to learn!
        </p>
			  <p>We’ll continue next week with additional demos before embarking on your first Illustrator assignment! (Feel free to look ahead to next week’s assignment if you wish to get a head start on viewing the videos!) Also, keep in mind that we will be working with this tool throughout the program; do not expect to be a master by the time you come into the classroom, and always feel free to explore ahead!

			  <p>
          Although you were thinking about a particular audience when you made your TV remote sketches, you got away with making a lot of assumptions about what that group of people wants from that device. UX designers are always working to confirm or deny assumptions by finding out what users really need, directly from the source (ideally). Throughout the program, we’ll work through a number of ways that designers work to identify and define user goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          One way research user needs that is to go “in-situ” or into the context of your users in order to find out how they work and play, what makes them frustrated or delighted, and where the opportunities are for your design to improve their lives. This is called contextual inquiry, as you know from your earlier reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now is a great time to start to get comfortable with this research method, as you’ll be required to do more of it once you get into the classroom. If you need to refresh your understanding of the method you can refer back to the reading assigned earlier this week.
        </p>

          <strong>NOTE:</strong> This assignment will continue for the rest of Prework, so choose your application wisely!

            Choose one of two tasks: (1) finding and booking a commercial airline flight or (2) finding a restaurant and booking a meal reservation. Decide whether you want to design a website or smartphone app for the chosen task.
          </li>
          <li>
            Define an audience by completing the statement: “My user is a _____, who wants to [find and book a flight OR find a restaurant and book a meal reservation].”  For example: My user is a working professional who wants to find and book a flight, or my user is a retiree who wants to find a restaurant and book a meal reservation. Make sure that you choose a group of people that you can easily meet with, as you’ll be required to do research with them twice throughout Prework.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pick three people within your audience and have them complete the task you’ve chosen (in step 1) using an existing tool of the same medium. For example: If you have chosen to do a flight booking website, you could watch them use Kayak.com; if you have chosen to design a restaurant reservation app, you could watch people use the OpenTable app.
          </li>
          <li>
            Type up your findings, identifying commonalities and/or differences amongst your three research participants. Include a revised goals statement that shows the results of your research, for example: My user is a working professional who wants to quickly find a trendy place for happy hour and date nights, or my user is a retiree who wants to find an economical and safe place to vacation with his spouse.

    <h2>Week 2: Prototyping</h2>
      <p>This week we will start to explore a process for effective prototyping. This begins with better understanding what a user’s mental model is, and how they use it to form an idea of how to interact with a design. You’ll take the results of last week’s research to create some initial wireframes for a restaurant or flight reservations booking tool that you will be working on for the next few weeks. We’re firmly planted in the “prototyping” stage of our design process!
      </p>

      <p>
        Our goals for you this week are to:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Understand mental models and how they impact the usability and user experience of a design
          </li>

          <p>
          Before you embark on creating your first set of wireframes, it’s critical that you understand two key principles: hierarchy and mental models. Hierarchy is a simple principle that can be difficult to execute: it means that the elements in your design clearly communicate various levels of importance. In other words, users can, at a glance, discern what’s most important, less important, and what is included as supporting details. A mental model is a user’s understanding of how a design should work. Users employ their mental models in order to make sense of and navigate a world that frequently has them interacting with new products, interfaces, and experiences. Major catastrophes can happen when a user’s mental model is misunderstood or not considered at all in a new or re-design.

            <p>
              Conceptual models can be one of the toughest ideas to explain and to understand. We introduce it this week through a variety of videos and readings that provide definitions and examples. However, it might still not make sense – and that’s ok. We’ll continue to discuss and demonstrate what a conceptual model (also called “mental model”) is throughout the entire program. Eventually, it will start to make sense and you’ll even be able to explain it to other people!
            </p>

           The following videos are a few different explanations of conceptual models by Don Norman, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654" target="_blank"><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em></a> and one of the most recognizable educators on usability and user experience.

            The reason it’s important to understand a user’s mental model is because it helps you make sense of how they (not you) expect the world—and the many designed artifacts within it—to work. This becomes helpful when you are evaluating how well designs are working or meeting user needs. You will be able to identify where breakdowns  between the user and their mental model occur.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last week, when you were watching users interact with existing flight apps or restaurant booking websites, you probably identified some places where the users’ mental model did not match what the design was doing. (Keep in mind that sometimes users recognize the mismatch and sometimes they don’t; it’s your job to notice!) Don Norman has a name for understanding these interaction mismatches, called “The Gulf of Execution and Evaluation.” Take a look and see what you think of his explanation! We’ll discuss them in Slack!

              Depending on who you ask or where you work, you may hear different definitions of “wireframe” and “prototype.” However, while the semantic difference can be important within a company, it doesn’t really matter what we call them. They are practically the easiest ways to communicate our design ideas (at various stages of fidelity) so that they can be evaluated by others. Wireframes and prototypes allow us to work cheaply and iteratively in order to get to an optimal design solution as efficiently as possible. You’ll hear more about how this works and why it’s important to our process in this week’s lesson, Wireframes & Prototypes!

              This week, we’ll continue to work on the project you chose last week (a restaurant/flight booker website/app) by creating a set of wireframes for some of the primary screens. You've already defined a specific audience that you will be designing for and evaluating with, and specified their goals (based on what you saw during your research). This week, you’ll sketch some ideas you have for the overall hierarchy and content layout of some of the main screens, including the home page or menu screen and the search page(s)/screen(s).

            <ol class="list">
              <li>
                Keeping your user and their goals in mind, sketch wireframes for at least three important screens, using pen & paper. Remember to consider the hierarchy of each layout, giving important information a more prominent place on the screen. Consider how you can match the mental model of users that you already researched, by using hierarchy to draw attention to the things most important to them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Provide a brief (1-2 sentences) explanation below each wireframe, to clarify the purpose of that screen.

              Now, we’re going to practice recreating these hand-sketched ideas in a digital medium using Adobe Illustrator. Since you already have a plan for what you’re making, it should be much easier for those of you who are newer to this tool. For those of you who are already familiar, see if you can learn something new while you’re doing it! (And then share your pro tip on Slack!)

      <p style="text-align: center; color: #07aa9e;">
        <em><strong>NOTE:</strong> You will have two weeks to complete the content for this week, due to the holiday schedule. </br>Please use your time wisely and stay in touch on Slack with any questions or tips!</em>
      </p><p>This week, we will start to cover the meaning of content within our app/website designs, including best practices for designing site structure and navigation elements. We will discuss methods for improving usability of designs by creating content that is more easily understood by our users while still meeting the needs of our client. We will also cover ways to evaluate how well our content is working for our users. You will expand on your assignment from previous weeks by adding a site map and navigation structure to your website/app. For this reason, we’ll remain in the “prototyping” phase of our design process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goals for this week are for you to:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Understand the purpose and use of ‘best practices’ or convention within design solutions
          </li>
          <li>
            Gain familiarity with methods and tools used to understand content structuring
          </li>
          <li>
            Gain experience in creating a meaningful and effective site structure for a website/app, based on previously conducted user research
          </li>
        </ul>

This helps them make more effective prototypes and saves time and money overall. During the classroom portion of this program, we’ll employ many of these methods during the “Identify” phase of our design process. Since we’re working on an abbreviated timeline, you’ll just be gaining exposure to these different methods during Prework. We’ll review, discuss further, and actually practice them once we get into the classroom!

              Now that we’re getting into the most complicated and meaningful pieces of a design, you may find yourself wondering “How will I ever be able to design all of this well?” It’s ok to feel this way, as it means that you are recognizing the importance of every single component of a product or experience, beyond the visual styling of that artifact (which is what many people think of when they hear the word “design”). While the visuals are incredibly critical, they are not the only layer of information that needs consideration. If the meaning, organization, and process of interacting with each component is not carefully considered and evaluated, the visual styling will simply be a nice looking layer on a poorly crafted experience.

            <p>
              We will spend a lot of time throughout the program talking about and implementing the principles that support good design. This week, we’ll focus on a couple organizational principles that help you achieve strong hierarchy: chunking and five hat racks.

            This week, your job is to design a structure for your site or app and determine the type of navigation that is most appropriate for your users, based on their primary tasks and goals. Keeping Krug’s mantra in mind, make things simple and meaningful for your users, so that the experience is quick and painless, leaving users feeling confident that they accomplished their goals correctly.

              To make things a bit more complicated (or clearer, depending on how you look at it), we’re going to require that you include the following items in your navigation structure. You can (and probably will find it’s necessary to) rename any of these items, rearrange them, and even nest them in sub-menus, if necessary.

      <h2>Week 4: UI patterns & Interactive prototypes</h2>
       <p>
       This week, we will go further into understanding a user’s mental model and how designers can more effectively match user expectations using well-established user-interface (UI) design patterns. You will start to understand how and when to employ best practices and explore when it may be appropriate to break convention. We’ll also be introducing you to HTML & CSS, two common languages used in the design of websites.
     </p>
     <p>
       By the end of this week, you will:
       <ul>
         <li>
           Understand how digital design elements can match or conflict with user expectations
         </li>
         <li>
           Transform digital wireframes into an interactive prototype using Axure
         </li>
         <li>
           Begin to understand the basics of HTML & CSS
         </li>

            When you are just learning how to design effective interfaces, it can be useful to leverage existing UI patterns and well-established conventions. Sometimes, there is reason to create a new convention (as when the old is a mental model mismatch) and other times we need to break convention to best meet our goals. But as a new designer, this is less frequently the case. Interestingly, the more you become familiar with conventions, you’ll find that there is a dark side to them; most people refer to these as “dark patterns.” Dark patterns toe a fine line between matching user expectations and manipulating expectations, usually for business gains. We’ll learn more about these and discuss their implications in Slack!

              One of the reasons we encourage you to start your designs with UI elements that are common and consistent with user expectations is because it saves your users time when they are trying to figure out how to use your new website or app. All UI elements afford some sort of interaction, and some afford many ways of interacting. Limiting these options to those most common can help you be more effective when first starting out as a designer. The more evaluations you conduct and learn about your users, the more likely it is that you can innovate or at least improve upon the elements you are using.

            This is an excellent course for an overview on HTML & CSS. We have heard from our software development students that this course was foundational in establishing some of the core concepts around using these two coding languages for web design.  As a UX designer, there are a number of reasons why <a href="http://jessicaivins.net/as-you-learn-ux-design-learn-how-to-code/" target="_blank">knowing HTML & CSS fundamentals is a competitive skill to possess</a> for many reasons, including being able to:

               Now that you’ve connected your set of three wireframes, you might be wishing that your prototype had a few more screens! While you certainly don’t need each and every screen to create a meaningful prototype, you should be thinking about what you would like to put in front of users to get feedback. That may mean that there are a few other screens that need designing.
             </P>
            <p>
              As you embark on creating some additional screens to enhance your prototype, we <strong>strongly recommend</strong> starting with a sketch, before working in Axure!

        <h2>Week 5: Evaluation</h2>
        <p>This week, we will introduce the most common ways that UX designers evaluate the effectiveness and usability of designs, including think-aloud usability tests.  We will explore how to conduct these evaluations, including preparation before, activities during, and what to do with the results. You will learn how to conduct a usability evaluation of a design and gain an understanding of what to do with the results of a test  session (or group of sessions) in order to improve upon a design. It should be clear that this week we are spending time in the “evaluate” portion of the design process!

                The focus of this week’s content is to gain familiarity with the tools and methods used to understand what users are doing and why they are doing it. Many times, we will want to combine methods, such as Google Analytics and usability testing, in order to get a richer picture of what is going on when people interact with our designs. Usability testing is one of the simplest ways to get feedback on wireframes and prototypes and can be conducted within any budget while still yielding meaningful results.

                To get prepared for this week’s assignment, you’ll want to read more details on how to conduct a think-aloud protocol, and what to do with your findings, as many organizations will have UXers prepare an evaluation report to share with the business team.

                <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/people/jakob-nielsen/" target="_blank">Jakob Nielsen’s</a> research concludes that testing with zero users will provide zero results (obviously), but even testing with one user can be useful. However, as a general rule, he recommends testing with 3-5 users per design iteration, in order to get the maximum returns on your efforts.

                  When conducting a usability test (or design evaluation of any kind, really), it is important to understand that while the research is not considered scientific, you do want your results to be as clean as possible. This means that you need to be aware of priming (or conditioning) your users before and during an evaluation session and otherwise exposing them to stimuli that would affect their responses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Read about the principles of <strong><em>Priming</em></strong> (pg 186-187) and <strong><em>Exposure effect</em></strong> (pg 86-87) in <em>Universal Principles of Design</em>.

                You’re already a bit familiar with Steve Krug and his take on usability, based on the reading you did in Week 3. This week, as you prepare for conducting some usability tests of your own, it’s a great time to watch a sample think-aloud usability test conducted by Krug himself. The test runs about 24 minutes but really is worth watching to get a true sense of how these tests are run and structured.

                    For many of you, this assignment may be the first usability test that you are conducting in a formal manner. If you’re uncomfortable or unsure of yourself, don’t worry—we will continue conducting tests of this nature a number of times throughout the program, and you’ll continually improve with practice. However, the best way to keep yourself as calm and prepared as possible is to prepare a test script (even experts do this, as shown in this <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/DigitalGov/usability-testing-report-template" target="_blank">presentation</a> and this <a href="http://www.sage-research.com/v4/sage_usability_study_report_example.pdf" target="_blank">formal report sample</a>). This also helps to standardize the test and stay focused on the goals of the study.

      <p>This last week, we will cover the basics of providing compelling design rationale in various ways. We will reflect on the previously learned content, and practice documenting what was done, why it was done, and what was designed as a result. The focus will be on creating documentation that effectively communicates design rationale and outcomes throughout the design process.

            <p>
            As a junior UX designer, it’s essential to have a portfolio that showcases and demonstrates your ability to succinctly, but meaningfully talk about your work, your process, and the reasons for your design decisions (i.e. your “design rationale”). These things are often shown along side samples of your work (wireframes, prototypes, affinity diagrams, journey maps, etc), but are as important (if not more important than) the design artifacts themselves. The presentation of your portfolio should be visually appealing with a clear hierarchy, with work samples shown at various stages of fidelity, such as seen in <a href="http://www.briennemooredesigns.com/projects/" target="_blank">Brienne Moore’s portfolio.</a>
           </p>
           <p>
             <a href="http://meetmichael.me/" target="_blank">Michael Nguyen</a>  is another great example of a UX designer recently entering the field from an architecture background. His case studies are highly narrative and introspective, and he does a great job breaking down how he thought through the design process on each project.
           </p>
           <p>
             By the time you’re a senior UX designer, you will likely have worked with large clients and have signed NDAs that precludes you from showing samples of your actual work. However, this doesn’t excuse you from having a portfolio, as this example of <a href="http://www.interactionexperience.ca/case-studies/%20" target="_blank">Kate Caldwell’s portfolio</a> demonstrates. She still tells a story, discusses her role in, and provides a client perspective for each project.

            During weeks 2-6, we worked through a project from sketches, to wireframes, to interactive prototypes – and even got feedback on how to make them better through critique and discussion about UI standards and other conventions.  This week it’s time to practice telling a compelling story about what you did during these 4 weeks, why you did it, and what resulted. Speak honestly, in your voice, while keeping it professional. Remember: everything you put online can and will be seen by anyone. Put your best foot forward!

              <p>After conducting your usability tests, you should have some ideas about what part of your wireframes could be improved, be it the hierarchy, the navigation, or the overall tone you used.  Now would be a great time to make those changes (trust us, you won’t want to do it later) so that you can tell a complete story in your UX portfolio for this project.

              <p>
                Remember, start with some sketches, then convert to digital. Finally, link them up in Axure! Good luck, and we'll see you next week!
