      <h2>Welcome to Prime!</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Prime! During the next 18 weeks you will gain experience in the entire UX lifecycle: from research, through prototyping, design, evaluation, and development. You’ll spend time working through the process of <strong>identifying</strong> goals, <strong>prototyping</strong> solutions, and <strong>evaluating</strong> how well those solutions meet the goals. We’re going to give you a taste of this complete process in Tier 1, introducing some design principles, methods, and tools used by professionals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of Tier 1 is to ensure that everyone comes to the classroom speaking a common design language. For some of you, there may be content that is familiar while for others this may all be new to you. In any case, we expect you to fully engage with the content, with your peers, and with your instructors. This is a team based learning environment; each of you have something to bring to the group as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a UX designer, you will be focused on crafting experiences that are both usable and meaningful for the intended users. You will also be responsible for a basic understanding of the business context that your design will operate within and the technical constraints that make it functional and reliable. We will start to understand what this takes in these next six weeks, and will dig even deeper once you’re in the classroom.
    </p>

          <div id="intro-2" class="collapse sub-content">
            <p>
              <strong>During Tier 1, we expect:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>
    12-20 hours of independent study each week
  </li>
  <li>
    Participation in weekly classes
  </li>
  <li>
    On-time submission of weekly assignments
  </li>
  <li>
    Meaningful and consistent communication with your peers
  </li>
  <li>
    Proactive communication with your instructors with questions or concerns
  </li>
</ul>
            </p><p>
              <strong>Communicate</strong></p>
      <p>
        This content is new to you. At times it may seem easy and other times, it will feel like you are underwater. Trust us, you are not the first person to feel this at Prime. It is part of the learning process, especially with practicing UX design.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every person at Prime has gone through this, even the staff and instructors. Know that the more you communicate your strengths and challenges, the stronger you will leave this program.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Complete all work</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Completing all the assigned work is key to your success. It may sound obvious, but you need to complete all work to finish the program. The work needs to be authentically yours, meaning that plagiarism is not tolerated. Handing in work that was completed by others does not teach you anything - the curriculum is designed to stretch you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Resetting your career is no small thing. We put a lot into the application process and we believe that you are capable of navigating this program.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Stay up to date</strong>
        </p>
      <p>
        It is extremely difficult to catch up in this program. Do your best during Tier 1 to have enough scheduled time each week to work on the content for the current week.
      </p>

      <p>
        We know that life happens! We have seen learners believe things will get better once they get in the classroom, that if they simply skim the Tier 1 content, things will be okay - this strategy has not worked for students. We are here to help, but we need to know about delays and questions as soon as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>We are here for you</strong>
        </p>
      <p>
        We expect there to be questions. We know that you are going to be challenged, have glorious "ah-ha!" moments, and experience every other emotion in-between. We are looking forward to helping you during this next phase of your life and we are dedicated to your success!
