          <div id="intro-2" class="collapse sub-content">
            <p>Each week, you will see a list of content to complete. Once you have finished the activities for the week, head over to the Slack discussion thread. There you will be posed a question that ties into the content you just finished reviewing. Share your thoughts on the topic, and check out your peers' responses and engage in additional conversation!
</p>
            <p>After the discussion, it’s time for the assessment. One important thing we want you to keep in mind throughout Prework, <strong>we will be reviewing this content in class the first week</strong>. The reason we emphasize this is that we want to make sure you all know that there is time to absorb this information. While we want you be learning the content, we also understand that it may take some time to do so. So if you are feeling stressed out that you aren’t grasping the concepts, don't stress out. Reach out to us and your fellow students, and give yourself time to review the content a second or third time.</p>
            <p>"It's together that you will succeed in Prime."</p>
            <p>This is a team based learning environment. We selected each of you because we feel you have something to bring to the group as a whole. We want you to engage with each other and with us.</p>
            <p>Finally, toward the end week, we will be have two, 30-minute live chat sessions. You only need to attend one. Despite offering two different times, there may be some people who cannot attend either in a given week. If this happens, please get in contact with us as soon as possible so we can ensure you don’t fall behind.</p>
            <p>The chats are a  chance for us all to share what we are learning that week, and for you to bring any questions that you may have. We will have those discussions through the video conferencing application GoToMeeting. You are welcome to use your camera, but it is not a requirement. We would like you to have a microphone, however, so you can interact with all of us. If neither of those are possible, just let us know that is the case through an email prior to the discussions.</p>
            <p>To recap:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Weeks are Monday morning to Sunday night. Monday is when we will be reviewing assignments you have submitted for the prior week. Once we have reviewed your assignments, we will touch base with you and provide feedback. Assessments need not be completed prior to the Live Chats, in fact we encourage you to bring whatever questions you have to them.</li>
              <li>Complete the Gymnasium lesson for each week, with the exception of the assignments. (We will complete slightly different assignments.)</li>
              <li>Participate in the discussion in Slack. Start by answering the weekly question, continue by interacting with your peers on their answers.</li>
              <li>Complete the Assessment each week.</li>
              <li>Come hang out for a half hour during one of the two live chats.</li>

      <h2>Week 1: UX Fundamentals</h2>
      <p>This week, we will start to explore some of the common principles, tools, and methods that are essential to designing effectively. You will start your journey of creating design artifacts, through hand sketching. You will also gain experience with conducting contextual inquiry, a key UX design research method, in order to help you identify the goals of your users. Most of this week’s content will keep us focused on the “Identify” portion of our design process, although we will dip a bit into prototyping for early practice. This stage helps us know what we’re designing and why, and is essential to working effectively in subsequent stages!
</p>
<p>
  Our goals for this week are for you to:
  <ul>
    <li>Understand the UX process model and the principles of user-centered design</li>
    <li>Know the importance of personas and their role in the UX design process</li>
    <li>Gain experience with converting ideas into hand drawn sketches</li>
    <li>Gain familiarity with using digital tools (Adobe Illustrator)</li>
    <li>Gain experience with conducting contextual inquiry</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Mark your calendars!</strong> This week’s Live Chat options are: Wednesday, December 7, 6:30-7:30pm or Friday, December 9, 12:00-1:00pm
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Remember:</strong> We recommend that you take a look at the week in its entirety before getting started.

</div>
          <div id="w1-1" class="collapse sub-content">
              <p>
                Throughout this program, we’ll be learning a lot more about the people who use our designs: what makes them happy, confused, satisfied, frustrated. This week’s lesson will start to talk about our users and how they aren’t us—a key principle to abide by when you’re a UX designer. There are some ways we can help to make our users real and different from us, including conducting research and crafting personas. You’ll learn more about this during the lesson and the rest of the week’s materials.
            </p>
            <p>Directions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Go to Gymnasium  Lesson 2: Taking the “you” out of the user </li>
                <li>As you go through the course, if there is content that’s confusing or unclear, feel free to discuss it in your cohort’s Slack channel!</li>
                <li>Skip the “Lesson Conclusion,” as it contains Gymnasium’s version of this week’s assignment. Instead, we’ll do our own assignment once we review a few more materials. But, definitely take the quiz as it’s a great way to check your understanding of the content!</li>

            Two key concepts that are being introduced this week are that of personas and contextual inquiry. Contextual research is an ethnographic research method that puts you into your user’s context in order to better understand how they do their work and achieve their goals (as pertains to the design you’re working on). Personas are a fictional representation of your users, (ideally) based on the synthesis of the research you’ve done with users in your target segments. They are typically used to guide the design team’s decisions and keep everyone focused on user goals.

          </div>
          <div id="w1-3" class="collapse sub-content">
            <p><strong>Sketching</strong> is an essential skill for a designer to have, which is why we’ll be working on it through the duration of the program. (It’s also the main reason why you’re required to invest in some good pens and a sketchbook!) If you feel concerned about your sketching skills, don’t worry. Many people equate sketching with “being good at drawing” but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. As a designer, pen & paper is the cheapest and most accessible tool used to communicate ideas or translate words into visuals that can be understood by everyone. Sometimes, it’s all you need to get everyone on the same page and keep the team moving forward!
            </p>
            <p>One fun way to get more comfortable with sketches is to start taking <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/11/how-to-get-started-with-sketchnotes/
" target="_blank">“sketchnotes”</a> of the week’s lecture materials! You’ll be able to practice some of the principles we are learning about (e.g. hierarchy, chunking), as well as practice thinking on the fly while letting go of perfectionism! A double-win!
            </p>
            <p><strong>Critique</strong> is another activity that designers are used to, and might seem unusual or scary when you first start. But  once you experience the power of an effective critique, you’ll might wonder how you could ever design without them! Critiquing is a professional forum used for giving and receiving feedback on how well (or not) your designs are achieving their goals. It is not a discussion of your personal abilities, but rather a professional discussion about your work. Critique a great place to exercise and strengthen your design vocabulary while practicing your presentation and listening skills.

			  <p>Now is a great time to start learning how to move from sketches to a digital medium. (It’s usually easier for beginners and experts alike to start with a sketch plan before working with a digital tool). If you’re totally new to Adobe Illustrator, don’t worry—we’ll walk you through the basics and continue to learn more about this tool throughout the program. Of course, Illustrator just one of many tools used by designers to create digital content. But, once you become familiar with this tool, many of the others become easier to learn!

			  <p>
          Although you were thinking about a particular audience when you made your TV remote sketches, you got away with making a lot of assumptions about what that group of people wants from that device. UX designers are always working to confirm or deny assumptions by finding out what users really need, directly from the source (ideally). Throughout the program, we’ll work through a number of ways that designers work to identify and define user goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          One way research user needs that is to go “in-situ” or into the context of your users in order to find out how they work and play, what makes them frustrated or delighted, and where the opportunities are for your design to improve their lives. This is called contextual inquiry, as you know from your earlier reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now is a great time to start to get comfortable with this research method, as you’ll be required to do more of it once you get into the classroom. If you need to refresh your understanding of the method you can refer back to the reading assigned earlier this week.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>NOTE:</strong> This assignment will continue for the rest of Prework, so choose your application wisely!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Directions:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Choose one of two tasks: (1) finding and booking a commercial airline flight or (2) finding a restaurant and booking a meal reservation. Decide whether you want to design a website or smartphone app for the chosen task.
          </li>
          <li>
            Define an audience by completing the statement: “My user is a _____, who wants to [find and book a flight OR find a restaurant and book a meal reservation].”  For example: My user is a working professional who wants to find and book a flight, or my user is a retiree who wants to find a restaurant and book a meal reservation. Make sure that you choose a group of people that you can easily meet with, as you’ll be required to do research with them twice throughout Prework.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pick three people within your audience and have them complete the task you’ve chosen (in step 1) using an existing tool of the same medium. For example: If you have chosen to do a flight booking website, you could watch them use Kayak.com; if you have chosen to design a restaurant reservation app, you could watch people use the OpenTable app.
          </li>
          <li>
            Type up your findings, identifying commonalities and/or differences amongst your three research participants. Include a revised goals statement that shows the results of your research, for example: My user is a working professional who wants to quickly find a trendy place for happy hour and date nights, or my user is a retiree who wants to find an economical and safe place to vacation with his spouse.
          </li>
          <li>
            Submit your findings as a PDF to the Assignments portal page.

    <h2>Week 2: Prototyping</h2>
      <p>This week we will start to explore a process for effective prototyping. This begins with better understanding what a user’s mental model is, and how they use it to form an idea of how to interact with a design. You’ll take the results of last week’s research to create some initial wireframes for a restaurant or flight reservations booking tool that you will be working on for the next few weeks. We’re firmly planted in the “prototyping” stage of our design process!
      </p>
      <p>
        We will also have our first on-site cohort visit this week! It’s a great time for you to meet each other, your instructor(s), and get your course texts.

          Before you embark on creating your first set of wireframes, it’s critical that you understand two key principles: hierarchy and mental models. Hierarchy is a simple principle that can be difficult to execute: it means that the elements in your design clearly communicate various levels of importance. In other words, users can, at a glance, discern what’s most important, less important, and what is included as supporting details. A mental model is a user’s understanding of how a design should work. Users employ their mental models in order to make sense of and navigate a world that frequently has them interacting with new products, interfaces, and experiences. Major catastrophes can happen when a user’s mental model is misunderstood or not considered at all in a new or re-design.

              Conceptual models can be one of the toughest ideas to explain and to understand. We introduce it this week through a variety of videos and readings that provide definitions and examples. However, it might still not make sense – and that’s ok. We’ll continue to discuss and demonstrate what a conceptual model (also called “mental model”) is throughout the entire program. Eventually, it will start to make sense and you’ll even be able to explain it to other people!
            </p>
            <p>
           The following videos are a few different explanations of conceptual models by Don Norman, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654" target="_blank"><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em></a> and one of the most recognizable educators on usability and user experience. Enjoy his quirkiness!

          <p>First, it's a good way to self-reflect on your own work style, learn about your fellow students, and understand howothers prefer to tackle challenges within group environments.</p>
          <p>Second, it's an assessment that's widely used within hiring partner organizations, so being able to speak confidently to your Strengths results may help you within future job interviews.</p>
