              Welcome to Prime! During the next 18 weeks you will gain experience in the entire UX lifecycle: from research, through prototyping, design, evaluation, and development. You’ll spend time working through the process of <strong>identifying</strong> goals, <strong>prototyping</strong> solutions, and <strong>evaluating</strong> how well those solutions meet the goals. We’re going to give you a taste of this complete process in Prework, introducing some design principles, methods, and tools used by professionals.
              </p>

              <p style="text-align: left">
                The goal of Prework is to ensure that everyone comes to the classroom speaking a common design language. For some of you, there may be content that is familiar while for others this may all be new to you. In any case, we expect you to fully engage with the content, with your peers, and with your instructors. This is a team based learning environment. We selected each of you because we feel you have something to bring to the group as a whole.
              </p>

              <p style="text-align: left">
                As a UX designer, you will be focused on crafting experiences that are both usable and meaningful for the intended users. You will also be responsible for a basic understanding the business context that your design will operate within and the technical constraints that make it functional and reliable. We will start to understand what this takes in these next six weeks, and will dig even deeper once you’re in the classroom.

      <h2>Week 1: UX Fundamentals</h2>
      <!--<img style="float: right; padding-right: 20px" src="/images/ux-processModel-identify.png" />-->
      <p>This week, we will start to explore some of the common principles, tools, and methods that are essential to designing effectively. You will start creating design artifacts through hand sketching. You will also gain experience with conducting contextual inquiry, a key UX design research method, in order to help you identify the goals of your users. Most of this week’s content will keep us focused on the “Identify” portion of our design process. This stage helps us know what we’re designing and why, and is essential to working effectively in subsequent stages.
</p>
<p>
  Our goals for this week are for you to:
  <ul>
    <li>Understand the UX process model and the principles of user-centered design</li>
    <li>Know the importance of personas and their role in the UX design process</li>
    <li>Gain experience with converting ideas into hand drawn sketches</li>
    <li>Increase your familiarity with Adobe Illustrator</li>
    <li>Gain experience with conducting contextual inquiry</li>
  </ul>

</div>
          <div id="w1-1" class="collapse sub-content">
              <p>
                Our goal as UXers is to learn as much as we can about the people who use our designs: what makes them happy, confused, satisfied, frustrated, etc. This week’s lesson will start to talk about our users and how they aren’t us—a key principle to abide by when you’re a UXer. There are some ways we can help to make our users real and different from us, including conducting research and crafting personas.
            </p>
            <p>Directions:</p>
              <ol class="list">
                <li>Go to Gymnasium <a href="http://gymnasium.aquent.com/courses/GYM/103/0/courseware/88724c300415487d8c1678bc4f776e47/08acad161f2143d6a568f2fcdd6ca143/" target="_blank">Lesson 2: Taking the “you” out of the user</a></li>
                <li>Skip the “Lesson Conclusion,” as it contains Gymnasium’s version of this week’s assignment. Instead, we’ll do our own assignment once we review a few more materials.</li>
                <li> Take the quiz to check your understanding of the content!</li>

          <p>
            Two key concepts introduced this week are personas and contextual inquiry.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Contextual research</strong> is an ethnographic research method that puts you into your user’s context in order to better understand how they do their work and achieve their goals.

            Read more about <a href="/resources/ContextualInquiry.pdf" target="_blank">contextual inquiry</a> (pdf)
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Personas</strong> are a fictional representation of your users, based on synthesized research findings. They are typically used to guide the design team’s decisions and keep everyone focused on user goals.
          </p>

            <em>(These readings are from <em>Universal Methods of Design</em> and <em>Universal Principles of Design</em>. Both books will be provided to you during your on-site visit next week. PDFs for future readings will <strong>not</strong> be provided.)</em>

          <div data-toggle="collapse" class="collapsed" data-target="#w1-3"><span class="action-type">Read</span>about sketching and critique
          </div>
          <div id="w1-3" class="collapse sub-content">
            <p><strong>Sketching</strong> is an essential skill for a designer to have, which is why we’ll be working on it through the duration of the program. If you feel concerned about your sketching skills, don’t worry. Many people equate sketching with “being good at drawing” but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. As a designer, pen & paper are the cheapest and most accessible tools used to communicate ideas or translate words into visuals that can be understood by everyone. Sometimes, it’s all you need to get everyone on the same page and keep the team moving forward!
            </p>
            <p>One fun way to get more comfortable with sketches is to start taking <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/11/how-to-get-started-with-sketchnotes/
" target="_blank">“sketchnotes”</a> of the week’s lecture materials! You’ll be able to practice some of the principles we are learning about (e.g. hierarchy, chunking), as well as practice thinking on the fly while letting go of perfectionism! A double-win!
            </p>
            <p><strong>Critique</strong> is another activity that designers are used to, and might seem unusual or scary when you first start. But once you experience the power of an effective critique, you’ll might wonder how you could ever design without one! Critiquing is a professional forum used for giving and receiving feedback on how well your designs are achieving their goals. It is not a criticism of your personal abilities, but rather a professional discussion about your work. Critique is a great place to exercise and strengthen your design vocabulary while practicing your presentation and listening skills. </p>

			  <p>Now is a great time to start learning how to move from sketches to a digital medium. (It’s usually easier for beginners and experts alike to start with a sketch plan before working with a digital tool). If you’re totally new to Adobe Illustrator, don’t worry—we’ll walk you through the basics and continue to learn more about this tool throughout the program. We don't expect you to become an expert. We just want to equip you with skills in a tool used for digital content creation. Once you become familiar with Illustrator, many of the others become easier to learn!
        </p>
			  <p>We’ll continue next week with additional demos before embarking on your first Illustrator-based assignment.

			  <p>
          Although you were thinking about a particular audience when you made your TV remote sketches, you got away with making a lot of assumptions about what that group of people wants from that device. UXers are always working to confirm or deny assumptions by finding out what users really need. Throughout the program, we’ll work through a number of methods that UXers employ to get this information.
        </p>
        <p>
          One method is to go “in-situ” or into the context of your users in order to find out how they work and play, what makes them frustrated or delighted, and where the opportunities are for your design to improve their lives. This is called contextual inquiry, as you know from your earlier reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now is a great time to lightly practice this research method, as you’ll be required to do more of it once you get into the classroom. If you need to refresh your understanding of the method you can refer back to the reading assigned earlier this week.
        </p>

          <strong>NOTE:</strong> This assignment will continue for the rest of Prework, so choose wisely!

          <li>
            Decide whether you want to design a website or smartphone app for the chosen task.
          </li>
          <li>
            Define an audience by completing the statement: “My user is a _____, who wants to [find and book a flight OR find a restaurant and book a meal reservation].” <em>(e.g. "My user is a recent retiree who wants to find a restaurant and book a meal reservation.")</em> Make sure that you choose a group of people that you can easily meet with, as you’ll be required to do research with them twice throughout Prework.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pick three people within your audience and have them complete the task you’ve chosen (in step 1) using an existing tool of the same medium. <em>(For example: If you have chosen to do a flight booking website, you could watch them use Kayak.com. If you have chosen to design a restaurant reservation app, you could watch people use the OpenTable app.)</em>

    <h2>Week 2: Prototyping</h2>
      <!--<img style="float: right; padding-right: 40px" src="/images/ux-processModel-prototype.png" />-->
      <p>This week we will start to explore a process for effective prototyping. This begins with better understanding what a user’s mental model is, and how they use it to form an idea of how to interact with a design. You’ll take the results of last week’s research to create some initial wireframes for a restaurant or flight reservations booking tool that you will be working on for the next few weeks. We’re firmly planted in the “prototyping” stage of our design process!
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goals for you this week are to:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Understand mental models and how they impact the usability and user experience of a design
          </li>
          <li>
            Create hand-sketched wireframes based on research findings
          </li>
          <li>
            Convert hand-sketches to digital wireframes in Adobe Illustrator

          <p>
          Before you embark on creating your first set of wireframes, it’s critical that you understand two key principles: hierarchy and mental models.  </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Hierarchy</strong> is a simple principle that can be difficult to execute: it means that the elements in your design clearly communicate various levels of importance. In other words, users can, at a glance, discern what’s most important, less important, and what is included as supporting details.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
            Read about <a href="/resources/Hierarchy.pdf" target="_blank">hierarchy (pdf)</a> (pg. 124-125)
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>mental model</strong> is a user’s understanding of how a design should work. Users employ their mental models in order to make sense of and navigate a world that frequently has them interacting with new products, interfaces, and experiences. Major catastrophes can happen when a user’s mental model is misunderstood or not considered at all in a new or re-design.

            <p>
              Conceptual models can be one of the toughest ideas to explain and to understand. We introduce it this week through a variety of videos and readings that provide definitions and examples. However, it might still not make sense – and that’s ok. We’ll continue to discuss and demonstrate what a conceptual model (or “mental model”) is throughout your time at Prime. Eventually, it will start to make sense and you’ll even be able to explain it to other people!
            </p>
            <p>
           The following videos are a few different explanations of conceptual models by Don Norman, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654" target="_blank"><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em></a> and one of the most recognizable educators on usability and user experience.

            The reason it’s important to understand a user’s mental model is because it helps you make sense of how they expect designs to work. This is especially helpful when you are evaluating how well designs, as you can more easily identify where breakdowns between the user's mental model and the interaction model occur.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last week, when you were watching users interact with existing flight apps or restaurant booking websites, you probably identified some places where the users’ mental model did not match what the design was doing. (Keep in mind that sometimes users recognize the mismatch and sometimes they don’t; it’s your job to notice!) Don Norman has a name for understanding these interaction mismatches, called “The Gulf of Execution and Evaluation.” Take a look and see what you think of his explanation! We’ll discuss them in Slack!

              Depending on who you ask or where you work, you may hear different definitions of “wireframe” and “prototype.” However, while the semantic difference can be important within a company, it doesn’t really matter what we call them. They are practically the easiest ways to communicate our design ideas (at various stages of fidelity) so that they can be evaluated by others. Wireframes and prototypes allow us to work cheaply and iteratively in order to get to an optimal design solution as efficiently as possible.

              This week, we’ll continue to work on the project you chose last week by creating a set of wireframes for some of the primary screens. You've already defined a specific audience and specified their goals. This week, you’ll sketch the ideas you have for the overall hierarchy and layout of some of the main screens, including the home page or menu screen and the search page(s)/screen(s).

Consider how you can match the mental model of users that you already researched, by using hierarchy to draw attention to the things most important to them.

      <h2>Week 3: Content Strategy & Information Architecture</h2>
      <p>This week, we will start to cover the meaning of content within our designs, including best practices for designing site structure and navigation elements. We will discuss methods for improving usability by creating content that is more easily understood by our users while still meeting the needs of our client. We will also cover ways to evaluate how well our content is working for our users. You will expand on your assignment from previous weeks by adding a site map and navigation structure to your website/app. For this reason, we’ll remain in the “prototyping” phase of our design process.

          <li>
            Understand the purpose and use of ‘best practices’ or convention within design solutions
          </li>
          <li>
            Gain familiarity with methods and tools used to understand content structuring
          </li>
          <li>
            Gain experience in creating a meaningful and effective site structure for a website/app, based on previously conducted user research
          </li>

            This week’s content should help you gain a new perspective on how important it is to pay attention to all the details of your design, including navigation structure, button language, and overall layout. This will just give you a taste of some of the things you need to consider and ways that you can decide if your decisions have been effective.

              UXers employ a number of methods in order to better understand what it is that needs to be built and why. This helps them make more effective prototypes and saves time and money overall. During the classroom portion of this program, we’ll employ many of these methods during the “Identify” phase of our design process. Since we’re working on an abbreviated timeline, you’ll just be gaining exposure to these different methods during Prework.

              Now that we’re getting into the most complicated and meaningful pieces of a design, you may find yourself wondering <em>“How will I ever be able to design all of this well?”</em> It’s ok to feel this way, as it means that you are recognizing the importance of every single component of a product or experience, beyond the visual styling of that artifact. While the visuals are incredibly critical, they are not the only layer of information that needs consideration. If the meaning, organization, and process of interacting with each component is not carefully considered and evaluated, the visual styling will simply be a nice looking layer on a poorly crafted experience.

              We will spend a lot of time throughout Prime talking about and implementing the principles that support good design. This week, we’ll focus on a couple organizational principles that help you achieve strong hierarchy: <strong>chunking</strong> and <strong>five hat racks</strong>.

              To make things a bit more complicated (or clearer, depending on how you look at it), you also need to include the following items in your navigation structure. You can rename any of these items, rearrange them, and even nest them in sub-menus, if necessary.

      <h2>Week 4: UI patterns & Interactive prototypes</h2>
       <p>
       This week, we will go further into understanding a user’s mental model and how designers can more effectively match user expectations using well-established user-interface (UI) design patterns. You will start to understand how and when to employ best practices and explore when it may be appropriate to break convention. We’ll also be introducing you to HTML & CSS, two common languages used in the design of websites.
     </p>
     <p>
       By the end of this week, you will:
       <ul>
         <li>
           Understand how digital design elements can match or conflict with user expectations
         </li>
         <li>
           Transform digital wireframes into an interactive prototype using Axure
         </li>
         <li>
           Begin to understand the basics of HTML & CSS

            <p>
            When you are just learning how to design effective interfaces, it can be useful to leverage existing UI patterns and well-established conventions. Sometimes, there is reason to create a new convention (as when the old is a mental model mismatch) and other times we need to break convention to best meet our goals. But as a new designer, this is less frequently the case. Interestingly, the more you become familiar with conventions, you’ll find that there is a dark side to them; most people refer to these as “dark patterns.” Dark patterns toe a fine line between matching user expectations and manipulating expectations, usually for business gains. We’ll learn more about these and discuss their implications in Slack!

            <p>
              One of the reasons we encourage you to start your designs with UI elements that are common and consistent with user expectations is because it saves your users time when they are trying to figure out how to use your new website or app. All UI elements afford some sort of interaction, and some afford many ways of interacting. Limiting these options to those most common can help you be more effective when first starting out as a designer. The more evaluations you conduct and learn about your users, the more likely it is that you can innovate or at least improve upon the elements you are using.

            This is an excellent course for an overview on HTML & CSS. We have heard from our software development students that this course was foundational in establishing some of the core concepts around using these two coding languages used in web design. As a UXer, there are a number of reasons why <a href="http://jessicaivins.net/as-you-learn-ux-design-learn-how-to-code/" target="_blank">knowing HTML & CSS fundamentals is a competitive skill to possess</a>, including being able to:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Better understand how a design gets translated into code
              </li>
              <li>
                Create or edit front-end code on your personal portfolio website
              </li>
              <li>
                Understand, edit, and create web-based prototypes

              <li>
                More effectively communicate with software developers

               Now that you’ve connected your set of three wireframes, you might be wishing that your prototype had a few more screens! While you certainly don’t need each and every screen to create a meaningful prototype, you should be thinking about what you would like to put in front of users to get feedback. That may mean that there are a few other screens that need designing.

        <h2>Week 5: Evaluation</h2>
        <!--<img style="float: right; padding-right: 40px" src="/images/ux-processModel-evaluate.png" />-->
        <p>This week, we will introduce the most common ways that UX designers evaluate the effectiveness and usability of designs, including think-aloud usability tests.  We will explore how to conduct these evaluations, including preparation before, activities during, and what to do with the results. You will learn how to conduct a usability evaluation of a design and gain an understanding of what to do with the results in order to make recommendations and improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be clear that this week we are spending time in the “evaluate” portion of the design process!
        </p>

       <p>
         By the end of this week, you will:
         <ul>
           <li>
             Gain experience executing a usability test on your prototype
           </li>
           <li>
             Gain familiarity with how to report findings in a test report
           </li>

                The focus of this week’s content is to gain familiarity with the tools and methods used to understand what users are doing and why they are doing it. Many times, we will want to combine methods, such as Google Analytics and usability testing, in order to get a richer picture of what is going on when people interact with our designs. Usability testing is one of the simplest ways to get feedback on wireframes and prototypes and can be conducted within any budget while still yielding meaningful results.

                <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/people/jakob-nielsen/" target="_blank">Jakob Nielsen’s</a> research concludes that testing with zero users will provide zero results (obviously), but even testing with one user can be useful. However, as a general rule, he recommends testing with 3-5 users per design iteration, in order to get the maximum returns on your efforts.

                  When conducting a usability test (or design evaluation of any kind, really), it is important to understand that while the research is not considered scientific, you do want your results to be as clean as possible. This means that you need to be aware of "priming" your users before and during an evaluation session and otherwise exposing them to stimuli that would affect their responses.

                You’re already a bit familiar with Steve Krug and his take on usability, based on the reading you did in Week 3. This week, as you prepare for conducting some usability tests of your own, it’s a great time to watch a sample think-aloud usability test conducted by Krug himself. The test runs about 24 minutes but really is worth watching to get a true sense of how these tests are facilitated and structured.

                    For many of you, this assignment may be the first usability test that you are conducting in a formal manner. If you’re uncomfortable or unsure of yourself, don’t worry—we will continue conducting tests of this nature a number of times throughout the program, and you’ll continually improve with practice. However, the best way to keep yourself as calm and prepared as possible is to prepare a test script. This is something even seasoned experts do, as shown in <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/DigitalGov/usability-testing-report-template" target="_blank">this presentation</a> and this <a href="http://www.sage-research.com/v4/sage_usability_study_report_example.pdf" target="_blank">formal report sample</a>.

      <h2>Week 6: Portfolio documentation</h2>
      <p>This last week, we will cover the basics of providing compelling design rationale in various ways. We will reflect on the previously learned content, and practice documenting what was done, why it was done, and what was designed as a result. The focus will be on creating documentation that effectively communicates design rationale and outcomes throughout the design process.

            As a junior UX designer, it’s essential to have a portfolio that showcases and demonstrates your ability to succinctly, but meaningfully talk about your work, your process, and the reasons for your design decisions (i.e. your “design rationale”). These things are often shown along side samples of your work (wireframes, prototypes, affinity diagrams, journey maps, etc), but are as important (if not more important than) the design artifacts themselves. The presentation of your portfolio should be visually appealing with a clear hierarchy, with work samples shown at various stages of fidelity.
           </p>
           <p>
             <a href="http://christinarichardson.ca/" target="_blank"</a>Christina Richardson</a> has recently found her fit in UX, after a career path that includes related fields such as psychology, research, and front-end development. Her featured case studies are similar to the work you will be doing at Prime.
           </p>
           <p>
             <a href="http://meetmichael.me/" target="_blank">Michael Nguyen</a> is a great example of a UXer recently entering the field from an architecture background. His case studies are highly narrative and introspective, and he does a great job breaking down how he thought through the design process on each project.
           </p>
           <p>
             By the time you’re a senior UXer, you will likely have worked with large clients and have signed NDAs that precludes you from showing samples of your actual work. However, this doesn’t excuse you from having a portfolio, as this example of <a href="http://www.interactionexperience.ca/case-studies/%20" target="_blank">Kate Caldwell’s portfolio</a> demonstrates. She still tells a story, discusses her role in, and provides a client perspective for each project.

             You’ll be working on adding projects to your portfolio and adjusting the format throughout the duration of the program. This week, we want to make sure you have a URL and that your web hosting is properly setup.
           </p>
           <p>
             Two recommended services are <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Squarespace</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.com" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>.  Both services manage the web hosting for you and allow you to customize the code on your site, something you’ll want to do once you feel comfortable with HTML & CSS. Wordpress offers a free service and both offer low-cost monthly fee option.

            During weeks 2-6, we worked through a project from sketches, to wireframes, to interactive prototypes – and even got feedback on how to make them better through critique and discussion about UI standards and other conventions. This week it’s time to practice telling a compelling story about what you did during these four weeks, why you did it, and what resulted. Speak honestly, in your voice, while keeping it professional. Remember: everything you put online can be seen by anyone. Put your best foot forward!

            <div data-toggle="collapse" class="collapsed" data-target="#w6-bonus" class="last"><span class="action-type">Complete</span>revisions to your wireframes and include them in your portfolio </div>
            <div id="w6-bonus" class="collapse sub-content">
              <p>After conducting your usability tests, you should have some ideas about what part of your wireframes could be improved, be it the hierarchy, the navigation, or the overall tone you used. Now would be a great time to make those changes (trust us, you won’t want to do it later) so that you can tell a complete story in your UX portfolio for this project.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember, start with some sketches, then convert to digital. Finally, link them up in Axure! Good luck, and we'll see you next week!
