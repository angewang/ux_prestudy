    <h2>Week 6: Portfolio documentation</h2>
    <p>This week we will explore ways we can tell compelling stories and explain our design rationale. We will reflect on the previously learned content and practice documenting what was done, why it was done, and what was designed as a result. The focus will be on creating documentation that effectively communicates design rationale and outcomes throughout the UX design process.

          As a junior UX designer, it’s essential to have a portfolio that showcases and demonstrates your ability to succinctly, but meaningfully talk about your work, your process, and the reasons for your design decisions (i.e. your “design rationale”). These things are often shown along side samples of your work (wireframes, prototypes, affinity diagrams, journey maps, etc), but are as important (if not more important than) the design artifacts themselves. The presentation of your portfolio should be visually appealing with a clear hierarchy, with work samples shown at various stages of fidelity.

           <a href="http://christinarichardson.ca/" target="_blank"</a>Christina Richardson</a> has recently found her fit in UX, after a career path that includes related fields such as psychology, research, and front-end development. Her featured case studies are similar to the work you will be doing at Prime.
         </p>
         <p>
           <a href="http://meetmichael.me/" target="_blank">Michael Nguyen</a> is a great example of a UXer recently entering the field from an architecture background. His case studies are highly narrative and introspective, and he does a great job breaking down how he thought through the design process on each project.
         </p> -->
         <p>
           By the time you’re a senior UXer, you will likely have worked with large clients and have signed NDAs that precludes you from showing samples of your actual work. However, this doesn’t excuse you from having a portfolio, as this example of <a href="http://www.interactionexperience.ca/case-studies/%20" target="_blank">Kate Caldwell’s portfolio</a> demonstrates. She still tells a story, discusses her role in, and provides a client perspective for each project.

           You’ll be working on adding projects to your portfolio and adjusting the format throughout the duration of the program. This week, we want to make sure you have a URL and that your web hosting is properly setup.
         </p>
         <p>
           We strongly recommend using <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Squarespace</a> for your portfolio, as your instructor(s) will be able to provide technical support for this platform. Another option is <a href="https://wordpress.com" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>. Both services manage the web hosting for you and allow you to customize the code on your site, something you’ll want to do once you feel comfortable with HTML & CSS. Wordpress offers a free service and both offer low-cost monthly fee option.

          During weeks 2-6, we worked through a project from sketches, to wireframes, to interactive prototypes – and got feedback on how to make them better through critique and discussion about UI standards and other conventions. This week it’s time to practice telling a compelling story about what you did during these four weeks, why you did it, and what resulted. Speak honestly, in your voice, while keeping it professional.

          <strong>Assignment directions:</strong>
          <ol class="list">
            <li>
              Purchase a unique URL and setup hosting for your UX portfolio
            </li>
            <li>
              Add documentation for the project you did in Prework
            </li>
            <li>
              Share your URL in Slack for feedback
            </li>
            <li>
              Submit your URL to the <a href="http://primeacademy.io/student" target="_blank">assignment portal</a>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div class="bonus-white">
      <h3>Take it further</h3>
      <ol class="white-li">
        <li>
          <div data-toggle="collapse" class="collapsed" data-target="#w6-bonus" class="last"><span class="action-type">Complete</span>revisions to your wireframes and include them in your portfolio </div>
          <div id="w6-bonus" class="collapse sub-content">
            <p>After conducting your usability tests, you should have some ideas about what part of your wireframes could be improved, be it the hierarchy, the navigation, or the overall tone you used. Now would be a great time to make those changes (trust us, you won’t want to do it later) so that you can tell a complete story in your UX portfolio for this project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember, start with some sketches, then convert to digital. Finally, link them up in Axure! Good luck, and we'll see you next week!
