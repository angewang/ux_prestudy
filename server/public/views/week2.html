    <h2>Week 2: Mental Models & Low-fidelity Prototyping</h2>
      <!--<img style="float: right; padding-right: 40px" src="/images/ux-processModel-prototype.png" />-->
      <p>This week we will start to explore the process of prototyping. This begins with better understanding what a user’s mental model is and how they use it to inform their actions. You’ll use last week’s research to create wireframes for a digital tool for food ordering or wellness <!--a restaurant or flight reservations booking tool--> that you will be working on for the next few weeks. We’re firmly planted in the “prototyping” stage of our design process!
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goals for you this week are to:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Understand mental models and how they impact the usability and user experience of a design
          </li>
          <li>
            Create hand-sketched wireframes based on research findings
          </li>
          <li>
            Convert hand-sketches to digital wireframes
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

          <p>
          Before you embark on creating your first set of wireframes, it’s critical that you understand two key principles: hierarchy and mental models.  </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Hierarchy</strong> is a simple principle that can be difficult to execute: it means that the elements in your design clearly communicate various levels of importance. In other words, users can, at a glance, discern what’s most important, less important, and what is included as supporting details.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-left: 40px">
            Continue reading about hierarchy (Universal Principles, pg. 122-123)
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>mental model</strong> is a user’s understanding of how a design should work. Users employ their mental models in order to make sense of and navigate a world that frequently has them interacting with new products, interfaces, and experiences. Major catastrophes can happen when a user’s mental model is misunderstood or not considered at all in a new or re-design.
          </p>

            <p>
              Conceptual models can be one of the toughest ideas to explain and to understand. We introduce it this week through a variety of videos and readings that provide definitions and examples. However, it still might not make sense – and that’s ok. We’ll continue to discuss and demonstrate what a conceptual model (or “mental model”) is throughout your time at Prime. Eventually, it will start to make sense and you’ll even be able to explain it to other people!
            </p>
            <p>
           The following videos are a few different explanations of conceptual models by Don Norman, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654" target="_blank"><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em></a> and one of the most recognizable educators on usability and user experience. Enjoy his quirkiness!

          <p>
            The reason it’s important to understand a user’s mental model is because it helps you make sense of how they expect designs to work. This is especially helpful when you are evaluating designs, as you can more easily identify where breakdowns between the user's mental model and the interaction model occur.
          </p>s
          <p>
            Last week, when you were watching users interact with existing <!--flight apps or restaurant booking websites-->food ordering websites or wellness apps, you probably identified some places where the users’ mental model did not match what the design was doing. (Keep in mind that sometimes users recognize the mismatch and sometimes they don’t; it’s your job to notice!) Don Norman has a name for understanding these interaction mismatches, called “The Gulf of Execution and Evaluation.” Take a look and see what you think of his explanation! We’ll discuss them in Slack!

              Depending on who you ask or where you work, you may hear different definitions of “wireframe” and “prototype.” However, while the semantic difference can be important within a company, it doesn’t really matter what we call them. They are practically the easiest ways to communicate our design ideas (at various stages of fidelity) so that they can be evaluated by others. Wireframes and prototypes allow us to work cheaply and iteratively in order to get to an optimal design solution as efficiently as possible.

              This week, we’ll continue to work on the project you chose last week by creating a set of wireframes for some of the primary screens. You've already defined a specific audience and specified their goals. This week, you’ll sketch the ideas you have for the overall hierarchy and layout of some of the most impactful or meaningful screens.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Then, digitize!</strong></br>
              When that's done, you'll gain practice digitizing these hand-sketches using the design program Sketch. Having a hand-sketched plan for what you want to make will make it easier to learn the new software tool.
